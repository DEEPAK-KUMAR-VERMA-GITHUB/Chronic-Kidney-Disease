# 🩺 CKD Prediction System

A machine learning-based web application for early detection and prediction of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) using clinical data. This project combines powerful data science techniques with a user-friendly interface to support healthcare professionals in real-time decision-making.

---

## 🚀 Features

* **Data Preprocessing**: Missing value imputation, outlier handling, SMOTE-based class balancing.
* **Model Ensemble**: Trained multiple ML algorithms—Random Forest, SVM, KNN, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost.
* **Real-Time Prediction**: Streamlit-based UI for manual entry or OCR-based input from scanned medical reports.
* **PDF Report Generator**: Automatically generates downloadable reports summarizing prediction results.
* **Performance Evaluation**: Includes metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, and ROC-AUC.
* **Domain Knowledge Integration**: Applies clinical thresholds alongside ML to enhance reliability.

## 🛠️ Installation

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.8+
* [Tesseract OCR](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract)

### Clone and Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ckd-prediction-system.git
cd ckd-prediction-system
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Configure OCR

Update the following line in `ckd_prediction_app.py` to match your OS:

```python
pytesseract.pytesseract.tesseract_cmd = r'C:\\Program Files\\Tesseract-OCR\\tesseract.exe'
```

---

## 💻 Usage

### Train the Model

```bash
python ckd_model_training.py
```

### Launch the App

```bash
streamlit run ckd_prediction_app.py
```

### Input Options

* **Manual Input**: Directly enter clinical data into form.
* **OCR Upload**: Upload scanned reports for automatic extraction.
